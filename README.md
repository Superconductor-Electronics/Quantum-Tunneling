# Simulating quantum tunneling

This code simulates quantum mechanical tunneling of an electron across a square potential barrier. 
The electron is represented by a 1D Gaussian wavefunction. 
1D time-dependent Schrodinger equation is solved using the finite-difference time-domain method.
The user can input the barrier height and width, and electron energy and spread.
